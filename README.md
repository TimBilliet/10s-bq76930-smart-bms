# 10S BLE smart BMS
A "smart" charge only BMS for a 10S battery pack.\
Cell monitoring and balancing using a BQ76930 BMS chip from Texas Instruments.\
This chip is controlled by an ESP32-C3 microcontroller via IÂ²C.\
The battery pack voltage and bms parameters are presented via Bluetooth Low Energy on the ESP32-C3\
This data can then be read and written by my Smart BMS App.

The PCB was designed in Altium Designer.\
The programming circuitry for the ESP32-C3 is on an external board to save space.

The firmware was made in ESP-IDF 5.1.3
