# 10S BLE smart BMS
A diy charge only bms for a 10S battery pack.
Cell monitoring and balancing using a BQ76930.
Main MCU is an ESP32-C3 that sends the data from the BQ76930 via BLE to an app.
The PCB was designed in Altium Designer.\
This PCB is meant for a diy E-skate, that's why it has some extra functions.
There is a header for connecting servo signals and a mosfet to switch 12V leds. The leds are supposed to light up when braking.
The programming circuitry for the ESP32-C3 is on an external board to save space.\
There is also a power latch circuit with a button and the mcu can turn power to itself off.\
The firmware was made in ESP-IDF 5.1.3

## Cloning
Clone with this command to also get the bq76930 driver component
```
git clone https://github.com/TimBilliet/10s-bq76930-smart-bms.git --recurse-submodules
```

## DONE:
Testing the cell voltage reading function(tested with existing Arduino library)\
Testing charge fet cutoff when overvoltage occurs(tested with existing Arduino library)\
Testing led mosfet (works, so does pwm dimming)\
Writing BQ76930 esp-idf driver

## TODO:
Write app\
Write firmware
